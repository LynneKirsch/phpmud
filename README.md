This is a mud I'm working on built in pure PHP & json. The front end uses simple HTML/JS/CSS to connect and display output.
I didn't want to fuck around with MySQL connections inside the react loop so I decided to create the database using JSON objects.
It's largely a work in progress but designed to "just work" with any server that has apache and PHP >= 5.5.

If you're interested in playing around with the code and building upon it feel free. Just check it out and open a bash terminal in 
root, type php Server.php then navigate to the index file. Bam. 

I created this repo mostly for my own versioning use. This is a side project I work on for fun, when there's time. If you 
have an issue with the code or a question or a request, you're welcome to ask  but at the end of the day I genuinely don't
care about you.
